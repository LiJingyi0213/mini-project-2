## Introduction
Robot Operating System is a flexible framework that designed for robot software development. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms. Its usefulness is not limited to robots, but most tools provided are focused on working with peripheral hardware.

## Pros
### Portability
Robot Operating System has many advantages. First, it was designed very portability, users do not need exchange main frame and system, because the code that is written by ROS can be used in other software framework of robots. 
### Language Independent
Language independent is also an advantage of ROS. The ROS framework is easy to implement in any programming language, such as Python, C++. 
### Simple Testing
Third is simple testing – ROS has a built-in unit/assembly testing framework called "rostest". This makes integration and decomposition debugging easy. Fourth is scalability – ROS is suitable for large real-time systems and large system development projects. 

## Cons

## Recommendations
It provides functionality for hardware abstraction, device drivers, communication between processes over multiple machines, tools for testing and visualization, and much more. Nodes in ROS do not have to be on the same system (multiple computers) or even of the same architecture. Users could have a Arduino publishing messages, a laptop subscribing to them, and an Android phone driving motors. This makes ROS really flexible and adaptable to the needs of the user. ROS is also open source, maintained by many people. That’s the reasons why people should use ROS.
